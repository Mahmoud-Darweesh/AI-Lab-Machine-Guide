# Useful GitHub Repos

1. [Denoising Diffusion PyTorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch)
   - Implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model in Pytorch. It uses denoising score matching to estimate the gradient of the data distribution, followed by Langevin sampling to sample from the true distribution.

2. [CycleGAN and Pix2Pix PyTorch](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix)
   - PyTorch implementations for both unpaired and paired image-to-image translation. It produces results comparable to or better than the original Torch software.

3. [PyTorch GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN)
   - Collection of PyTorch implementations of Generative Adversarial Network varieties presented in research papers. Contributions and suggestions of GANs to implement are very welcomed.

4. [Keras GAN](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN)
   - Collection of Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) suggested in research papers. Contributions and suggestions of GAN varieties to implement are very welcomed.
